Analysis of pancreatic cancer transcriptomics datasets with general and pancreatic cancer specific pathway models

Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality and has a low five-year survival rate of less than 10%. With the use of these workflows, the gene expression of pancreatic tumor tissue can be analyzed and visualized. 

The following components are part of the workflow of dataset 1: 
* downloading and preparing the data
* quality control of the data
* differential gene expression analysis
* pathway and gene ontology enrichment analysis, and 
* data visualization on pancreatic cancer-specific pathway models
 
The workflow of dataset 2 contains these components: 
* downloading and preparing the data
* quality control of the data
* differential gene expression analysis 
* visualization of differentially expressed genes
* data visualization on pancreatic cancer-specific pathway models 
* pathway and gene ontology enrichment analysis, and 
* pathway overlap visualization
